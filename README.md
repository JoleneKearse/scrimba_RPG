My version of the Role Playing Game from Scrimba's Module 7: Next Level JavaScript with cute animals!

This [module](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend/next-level-javascript-intro-cQgLG9uP) is split into four parts devoted to building a Role Playing Game. But it does an absolutely *amazing* job preparing you to use **ES6** concepts in this project:
- **object destructuring** to quickly create variables to work with from characterData
- **.map()** as a 'slicker' alternative to loops
- **.join()** to clean up the results from creating an array before using **innerHTML** to add elements to the DOM
- **constructor functions** to easily create new instances of character objects
- **.fill()** to 'fill' created arrays
- **object.assign()** to quickly populate new object instances with properties from characterData
- **.reduce()** to merge the *diceHtml* to one value
- **ternary operators** as a 'more-readable' form of **if statements**
- **arrow functions** for less typing and cleaner code
- **setTimeout()** to improve the UI

I made it my own by making it **responsive** and adding a **Reset button**.
